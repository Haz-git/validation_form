Hello, 

Messing around with a form with fields. Validation was created using JS logic. This project was created referencing TraversyMedia, but with my own spin on design.

Eventually, I want to incorporate forms such as these into my landing pages. This project taught me much about DOM manipulation through event validation.

To use, place all the files within the same directory and run on live server. Or host the HTML file on web browser.
